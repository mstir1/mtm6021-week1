            <p>My name is Matthew Stirling, I was born on September 24th, 2003. My favorite things to do is writing, playing video games and listening to music. The past year I took a break from school to get a job and make some money. I found a job at a nursing home as a housekeeper. I worked for the year and I put some of that money down for my laptop. I am a hard worker, I have made some friends in the first seminster of college and since I have got here.</p>
